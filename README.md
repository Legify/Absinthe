Absinthe
========

Ἀψίνθιον. A highly integrated, advanced and cluster-ready server.

*Absinthe* is a pure and beautiful boilerplate to kickstart web-app development. *Absinthe* is released under non-restrictive conditions and is extremely extensible. It is an abstraction of some of our core technologies and may be considered mature. It sports in-flight compression (gzip, deflate), stream caching and a hilarious performance.

Installation
------------

  Clone *Absinthe*, setup using `npm install` and you're ready to go.

Usage
------------

    As the HTTP port is below 1234, Absinthe has to be run with root-priviliges.
